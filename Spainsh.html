    <p>In art we were assigned to create a art installation for the school exhibition. It was a group assignment that took like a month and a half to finsh. We made our installation Fearful for the halloween season to set a scary and frightening tone. We drew a large scale creature to create a sense of intimidation and fright for the audience. By painting the walls black and using the enclosed bottom of the stairwell, we wanted the viewer to feel dark and enclosed, as if there was no way out and to also intimidate the audience. The inspiration we used for this installation is the fear we have in our heart and the way everybody acts towards each other. The space we chose added to our overall dark mood.</p>
    
    
    <p>My role in this project was painting ,taking pictures, and recording video.. During the project work time, we sometimes had to switch roles to help others with certain aspects. I think I contributed a lot to the group by sharing my opinion and keeping the group on task, making sure the creature painting was hung by exhibition.  
            Our group was successful in the collaboration of all the group members getting along to  make this one large installation. Everybody in the group got along together,  trying their hardest to complete the project on time. The location we chose for our installation  worked well.  Underneath the stairs with it  painted black made the audience feel enclosed, it was amazing.
          To improve our project,  I would change the length of the project because it wasn't planned well.  We had to rush at the end of the project to install the final pieces including the painting, branches, and lighting. I would also change roles of the project because I kind of forgot to take photos and video and that was kind of major to the project. Last thing, I would change was not let Michael be the the speaker at exhibition he was making everything about himself.
            I learned that there is more to art than drawing and painting. Art is a way people can express themselves. anything people expression themselves using anything. Art can be a gift people give to the world, sharing their imagination? Gift that people have to expression their imagination to the world.  </p>
